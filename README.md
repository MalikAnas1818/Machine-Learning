        ###Target (Prediction) Feature always present in dataset
        ###Classification (Color Countable - Categories (Green, Red, Blue etc))
                ####Logistic Regression
                ####KNN
                ####Decision Tree
                ####Random Forest
                ####Navie Bayes
                #### etc
                        ###Performance Metrics
                                ###Accuracy
                                ###Precision
                                ###Recall
                                ###F1-Score
                                ###Confusion Matrix
                                ###Classification Report
        ### Regression (Uncountable - (Age, Salary, Price etc))
                ####Linear Regression
                ####KNN
                ####Decision Tree
                ####Random Forest
                ####etc
## >>>Unsupervised Learning
        ###Target Feature doesn't present in dataset
        ###Clustering (Clusters - (Fruits, Furniture, People etc))
                ####KMeans 
                ####Density Based (DBSCAN)
                ####Hierachical
                ####Gaussian Based Clustering
                
## >>>Reinforcement Learning
        ###Robotics
            ###Q-Learning
## >>>Semi-Supervised Learning
        ###Half Target data present in dataset
